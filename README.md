# Park Off

Community powered parking discovery for Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Find free parking, paid parking, street parking, and community verified spots on a live map.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) |
| UI | React 19.2, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Map | Mapbox GL JS v3 |
| Database | Supabase (planned) |
| OCR | Google Vision API (planned) |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9 or higher ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A free Mapbox account for the map token ([sign up](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/))

## Getting started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd parking-platform
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs everything from `package.json`. The `node_modules` folder is gitignored so it is not in the repo.

### 3. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace the placeholder with your real Mapbox token:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.your_actual_token_here
```

Get a token from [account.mapbox.com/access-tokens](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/). Public tokens start with `pk.`. The `.env` file is gitignored so you will never accidentally commit a real token.

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` | Yes | Mapbox public token. Must start with `pk.` |

When you add a new variable: add a placeholder line to `.env.example` and update this table. That way the next person to clone the repo knows exactly what they need.
